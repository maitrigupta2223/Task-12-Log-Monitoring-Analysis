#  Task 12: Log Monitoring \& Analysis

 Objective

To analyze authentication logs from Linux and Windows systems to detect failed logins, anomalies, and security events.

Tools Used

* Linux authentication logs (/var/log/auth.log)
* Windows Event Viewer (Security Logs)

Analysis Performed

* Reviewed login and sudo authentication logs
* Identified failed password attempts
* Correlated authentication and privilege escalation events
* Checked for abnormal behavior patterns

 Findings

* Few failed sudo authentication attempts due to incorrect passwords
* Multiple successful authorized sudo sessions
* No unauthorized SSH logins detected
* Windows logs showed normal logon and privilege assignment events

 Conclusion

Log analysis helped identify authentication activities and confirmed normal system behavior, demonstrating the importance of log monitoring in incident detection.
